# Goals & Philosophy - Intuitives

## Vision
**Intuitives** is a rule-free, experimental DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) designed to democratize music production by replacing technical learning curves with intuition, randomness, and AI-assisted discovery.

## Philosophy
- **No Guardrails:** Traditional music theory (keys, time signatures) is optional. The user focuses on "Does this sound cool?" rather than "Is this technically correct?".
- **Multimedia Input:** Music can start from anywhere—a picture of a dog, a webcam gesture, or a random text string. The app converts these inputs into MIDI/Audio.
- **Visual Feedback:** Sound is seen as well as heard. Geometric fractals and fluid simulations react to the audio, allowing users to "shape" the sound visually.
- **AI as a Jam Partner:** The AI doesn't just "generate a song"; it harmonizes with what you play, suggesting layers or effects in real-time.

## Core Loop
1.  **Seed:** Drop an image, video, or text to generate a base musical idea (MIDI/Samples).
2.  **Harmonize:** The AI analyzes the seed and builds a complementary soundscape (Drums, Bass, Pads).
3.  **Perform:** Use webcam gestures or mouse movements to manipulate the "Vibe" (Tempo, Reverb, Distortion) in real-time.
4.  **Refine:** Visually "pull" on the soundwaves to adjust the mix (Compression, EQ) without touching a fader.
